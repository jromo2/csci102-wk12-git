The incremental build model essentially breaks a project down into smaller developments. 
This way each successful integration into the project can be kept track of.
This allows us to test portions of our code and revert back to an earlier version if something goes wrong.
It is helpful for communication, planning, organization, modeling and construction. By using the incremental build model, we can finish projects faster with less confusion and therefore less time and money wasted.
